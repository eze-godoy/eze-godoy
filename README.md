## Know more about me :man_technologist:

- 👋 Hi, I'm @eze-godoy
 
- 👀 I'm interested in cloud architecture, monitoring, and automation
  - 👾 What do I code here? Mostly IaC. A lot of Terraform. But keeping an eye on other technologies like Pulumi and Crossplane, to mention some.
  - 🐍 Yep, also Python. In most cases, for serverless function and automation.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning ... well is hard to pick one. Let's say that my focus for learning now is on Blockchain.
 
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects. I think it is time to participate in some projects with social impact. Not everything is money.
